# Stop here...

This is the original script for defining the DB on an Azure SQL Server, but we have since decided to go with MySQL on AWS.
This script is kept here future ref, just in case we go back to SQL Server.

You can find the MySQL scripts in the [../MySQL](https://github.com/jay-hood/electionmoney/tree/master/Db/MySQL) folder.
