# Development Environment
Individual developers will create their own database instances on their machines for development purposes.  Just be sure to keep the SQL scripts updated as needed so everyone is on the same page.  Only DB changes that are scripted will be considered official.  If you need help with this, contact Wayne S (<gratefulBayou@gmail.com>).
